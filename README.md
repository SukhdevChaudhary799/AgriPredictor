# AgriPredictor
It is a Machine Learning predictive model for best crop to yeild under some atmoshperic conditions like rain_percentage, humidity, temperature and also based on amount of nitrogen, phosphourous, potassium and ph of soil.
It is a supervised learning model. First I have trained the model using the past data with all mentioned feature and label for the name of crop that previously yeild best under those conditions.
I have used the random forest classifier to predict the best crop for new input.
Accuracy of this model is around 99%.
